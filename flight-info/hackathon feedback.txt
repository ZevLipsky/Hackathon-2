Weather APP.
Register & Login mechanism works, great job!
When registering a new user and passwords do not match the app refreshes the page with a message.
When this happends all of the user information is deleted from the form ( Name, email, passwords), maybe
you could keep the information there or disable the register button until all requierments are met !
Good Redirect from register to login page.
The app works and you've demonstrated all of the things learnt in class. The file structure is good and you use .env which is great.
I would just add one thing: A reason to justify register/login. 
The app works wonderfully as I said, but is not different than googling the weather. I would add an option to save the cities searched to a "favorites" list , which can be in the database , and when the user logs in , he can see/add/remove from his favorites.
